This vulnerability is due to improper reassembly of large packets that occurs when VFR is enabled on either a tunnel interface or on a physical interface that is configured with a maximum transmission unit (MTU) greater than 4,615 bytes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending fragmented packets through a VFR-enabled interface on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition."
