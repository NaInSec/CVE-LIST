When logging in as a user with SSO enabled an attacker may authenticate as an other user. Any user account which does not have a second factor enabled could be compromised. This issue has been addressed in commit `8173f6512a` and in releases starting with version 0.7.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should require their users to use a second factor in authentication."
