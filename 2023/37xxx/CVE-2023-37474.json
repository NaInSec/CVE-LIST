The Path Traversal attack technique allows an attacker access to files, directories, and commands that reside outside the web document root directory. This issue has been addressed in commit `043e3c7d` which has been included in release 1.8.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
