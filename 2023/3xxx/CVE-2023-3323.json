Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they block the known attack vectors.\n• For CVE-2023-3323, Recommended practices include that process control systems are physically protected,\nhave no direct connections to the Internet, and are separated from other networks by\nmeans of a firewall system that has a minimal number of ports exposed.  Remove the default directory permissions for ‘Everyone’ on the service grid, ABB utilities, and zenon_Projects directories and provide access only to specific users that are\nexpected to access zenon.  Install the IIoT services, which is, the Service grid component on a separate system.  Secure the ZEE600 related executable files in ‘C:\\ProgramData\\ABB\\ABBUtilities’ directory by removing the group named “Everyone”.  Ensure the group name “Everyone” should be removed from the following directory.\n‘C:\\ProgramData\\ABB’.  Secure zenon_Projects directory by managing the access permissions. The project directory should have access only for the user group (Excluding administrator) which has\nthe users to use zenon projects.
