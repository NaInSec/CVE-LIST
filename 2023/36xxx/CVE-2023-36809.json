The previous Nginx configuration was incorrect allowing certain browsers like Firefox to ignore the `Content-Type: text/plain` header on some occasions thus allowing potentially dangerous scripts to be executed. Additionally, file upload validators and parts of the HTML rendering code had been found to require additional sanitation and improvements. Version 12.5 fixes this vulnerability with updated Nginx content type configuration, improved file upload validation code to prevent more potentially dangerous uploads, and Sanitization of test plan names used in the `tree_view_html()` function."
