Albums are used to create collections of images that can be inserted into web pages across the site. Albums allow the upload of various filetypes, which undergo a normalization process before being available on the site. Due to lack of file extension validation, it is possible to upload a crafted JPEG payload containing an embedded PHP web-shell. An attacker may navigate to it directly to achieve RCE on the underlying web server.
