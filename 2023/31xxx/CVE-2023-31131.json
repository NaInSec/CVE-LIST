In versions prior to 6.22.3 Greenplum Database used an unsafe methods to extract tar files within GPPKGs. greenplum-db is vulnerable to path traversal leading to arbitrary file writes. An attacker can use this vulnerability to overwrite data or system files potentially leading to crash or malfunction of the system. Any files which are accessible to the running process are at risk. All users are requested to upgrade to Greenplum Database version 6.23.2 or higher. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
