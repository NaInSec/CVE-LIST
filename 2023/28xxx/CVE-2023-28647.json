In versions prior to 4.7.0 when an attacker has physical access to an unlocked device, they may enable the integration into the iOS Files app and bypass the Nextcloud pin/password protection and gain access to a users files. It is recommended that the Nextcloud iOS app is upgraded to 4.7.0. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
