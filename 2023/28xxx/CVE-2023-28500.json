Adobe LiveCycle ES4 version 11.0.1 and later may be vulnerable if the application is installed with Java environment 7u21 and earlier. Exploitation of the vulnerability depends on two factors: insecure deserialization methods used in the Adobe LiveCycle application, and the use of Java environments 7u21 and earlier. The code execution is performed in the context of the account that is running the Adobe LiveCycle application. If the account is privileged, exploitation provides privileged access to the operating system. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer."
