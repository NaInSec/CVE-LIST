In affected versions the Google Analytics element in vulnerable to Attribute Injection leading to Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS). Since the custom status interface can set an independent Google Analytics ID and the template has not been sanitized, there is an attribute injection vulnerability here, which can lead to XSS attacks. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `f28dccf4e` which is included in release version 1.23.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
