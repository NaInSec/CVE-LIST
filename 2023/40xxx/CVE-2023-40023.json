This vulnerability allows attackers to include files from the server's local file system through the web application. When exploited, this can lead to the unintended exposure of sensitive data, potential remote code execution, or other security breaches. Users utilizing versions of the Yak Engine prior to 1.2.4-sp1 are impacted. This vulnerability has been patched in version 1.2.4-sp1. Users are advised to upgrade. users unable to upgrade may avoid exposing vulnerable versions to untrusted input and to closely monitor any unexpected server behavior until they can upgrade."
