Affected versions of Peering Manager are subject to a potential stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack in the `name` attribute of AS or Platform. The XSS triggers on a routers detail page. Adversaries are able to execute arbitrary JavaScript code with the permission of a victim. XSS attacks are often used to steal credentials or login tokens of other users. This issue has been addressed in version 1.8.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n"
